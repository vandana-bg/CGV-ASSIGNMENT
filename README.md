#This is our 3D house CGV mini project
We found designing and developing this 3D House as a very interesting and 
learning experience. It helped us to learn about computer graphics, design of Graphical 
User Interfaces, interface to the user, user interaction handling and screen management. 
The graphics editor provides all and more than the features that have been detailed in the 
university syllabus .
